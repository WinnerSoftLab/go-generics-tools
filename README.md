Introduction
------------

The [Heap](binheap/README.md) package contains simple [binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap) implementation, using Golang
generics. There are several heap implementations
[Details](binheap/README.md).


The [ShardedLockMap](smap/README.md) package contains implementation of sharded lock map.
Interface is similar to sync.map, but sharded lock map is faster on scenarios with huge read load with rare updates,
and uses less memory, doing less allocations.
[Details](smap/README.md)

Compatibility
-------------
Minimal Golang version is 1.18. Generics and fuzz testing are used.
